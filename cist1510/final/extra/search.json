    "content": "Backend Web Development\nBackend Web Development\n\nBackend web development is becoming increasingly critical with the need for interactive websites making access to information more efficient alongside data processing, especially in the realm of e-commerce. Various popular services including Amazon, Netflix, and Google leverage artificial intelligence to advance initiatives.\n\nFor Google, their backend systems publish search results based upon a user’s location, interests, and a variety of factors related to websites, heavily emphasizing design. It’s not uncommon to see Google’s analytics service to be included in many websites and it’s often hard to stay away from them. Their systems work by using JavaScript to submit data to their services which is then stored inside of a database for view later by webmasters and analysis by the company – often leading up to targeted advertising.\n\nWith the power of backend web development being laid upon programming languages such as PHP, JavaScript (server-side, such through node.js), Java, Ruby, and more, it’s permitting shared hosting to thrive.\n\nJust recently, cPanel increased pricing to not only be based upon the amount and type of servers it was installed on, but also now the number of users using a server. With their monopoly over the website control panel industry, it’s hard to escape and causing many businesses to raise prices. cPanel is an application which manages a web server’s software through backend programming languages and can even manage the languages themselves with the power of CloudLinux such through PHP and Node.js version selectors and even Python.\n\nEvidently, it’s necessary for web developers to expand their skill sets and acquire some background in backend web development to become more competent in the industry.",

    "content": "Why is Web Design Important?\n\nWebsite developers help make the internet easier to navigate and thereby help spread information. With this information, people can make more informed decisions alongside spread their ideas to help the world.\n\nDesigners have been raking in more and more money on average and with the rise of more information technology companies, this trend is bound to continue.\n\nShould I learn Website Development?\n\nNearly everyone in the computer programming should get some basics in website development as often times backend languages such as Java and Python interact with the frontend and especially languages such as PHP and JavaScript.How do I get started?\n\nFor many, it's often best to simply analyze other websites. GitHub provides a variety of open source examples which are made to be read by other developers and future developers. You can begin by simply modifying existing works or using snippets of them in your own and learn on your way with an objective on what to create.\n\nFor others, it may be ideal to enroll in a course designed to slowly expose materials such through your local technical college or an online platform supplemented by Devify.",

    "content": "Learn With Devify\nWhat is HTML?\n\nHTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. While many people believe it is, HTML is not a programming language and instead a framework. Parsing of HTML is dependant on the renderer's browser, however it is generally based on standards by the W3C.\n\nIt is used in front-end website development, making interacting with programs in the back-end such as those written with PHP or JavaScript (typically node.js) easier.\n\nIt uses the .html file extension, however older systems may use .htm with uniform three character file extensions.\nWhat is CSS?\n\nCSS is a stylesheet language which generally accompanies HTML. It stands for cascading style sheet and rendering is based upon standards, however is not uniform.\n\nIt uses the .css file extension.",
